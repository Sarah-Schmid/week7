# week7

This week I completed a variety of coding challenges from https://www.codewars.com/.
My solutions to all these challenges are in my jschallenges.js file.
You can also view my account and all of these challenges at https://www.codewars.com/users/sarahschmid

This week I also practiced using pure HTML to create a website.
